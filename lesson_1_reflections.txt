How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
- See the changes

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
- Can track all changes

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
- Pro: Can fully control the commit
- Cons: May loose changes

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
- For coding, each change usually relates to many files.  For document, each change normally relates to only one file.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
- cd to the repository, and issue "git log" command
- issue "git diff <first id> <second id>" command

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
- I can revert it back

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
- Keep my project code


My Note:
Notepad++ Setup
git config --global core.editor "'C:/Program Files/Notepad++/notepad++.exe' -multiInst -notabbar -nosession -noPlugin"

For .bash_profile
alias notepad="/c/Program\ Files\ \(x86\)/Notepad++/notepad++.exe"
